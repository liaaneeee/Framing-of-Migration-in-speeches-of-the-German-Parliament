# Description
This repository contains the course project for the seminar **Automatische Textanalyse in den Politikwissenschaften** of the University of Potsdam.

It contains a corpus with annotations for the framing of migration in speeches of the German Parliament and an implementation of a classifier for the automatic classification of stereotypes. <br>
This project is an attempt to replicate the study ***How Do You Speak about Immigrants? Taxonomy and StereoImmigrants Dataset for Identifying Stereotypes about Immigrants*** by SÃ¡nchez et al. (2021).
